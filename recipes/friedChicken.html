        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Originally I found myself buying bags of mass produced "chicken strips" or boxes of "fried chicken" both had a unique set of disappointment. Eventually experimentation with chicken and oil would bring me to this finished dish, which became my favorite fried chicken go to dish. I use this with breasts, legs, boneless skinless any kind of chicken. Add a side of vegetables or rice and dinner is served! I find the dish to be high on satisfaction and belly filling.</p>
